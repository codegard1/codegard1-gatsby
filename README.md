This repo contains the code for my personal site, codegard1.com. It is a dev blog created with Gatsby, using the Developer Diary Starter. 


*Developer Diary is a Gatsby Starter blog template created with web developers in mind, but really, anyone can use it. It's totally usable right out of the box, but minimalist enough to be easily modifiable to suit your needs. No matter how much you change it, though, you'll definitely want to make use of the tech tags and developer social media links, and maybe even make some of your own.*<br>
